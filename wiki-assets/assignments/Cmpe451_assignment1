HW1: Setup, Review, and Revision

First, make sure all your team members have access to your project repository. If you wish to add new people to your repository, please gather the GitHub usernames of the newcomers and send them to us over Piazza in a single post, so that we can add them for you.

The requirements you prepared last semester need to be examined and studied carefully. Everything you do throughout the development will rely on these requirements. Also, your final product will be tested against these requirements.

Therefore, it is crucial that the requirements are agreed upon by your team and customer, they are feasible to implement, consistent, and complete as possible.

1) Your first assignment is to revise and update your 

   * requirements
   * mockups
   * design
   * project plan

2) To be used during our meeting, prepare a list of questions and clarifications to refine the requirements. 

3) As always, document your group meetings minutes.

4) Track your personal tasks & estimated and actual effort.


All updates must be committed to your project repository.
